# MontyHall
A program that simulates the infamous Monty Hall Problem, should you switch doors? This program was designed to help understand the probability of the problem and why mathematicians say you should always switch doors, despite having only two doors left. 

A wikipedia article describing the problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem



### Use command line arguments to run the files. 
- ```MontyHall.java``` runs with one parameter [# of doors]. In the original problem the number of doors is 3. 
- ```MontyHallSimul.java``` runs with three parameters [# of games/simulations run] [# of doors] [Y for switch, else N] (If you want to switch doors in your simulations)
